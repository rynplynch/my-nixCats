# Ryan's Neovim configuration

## nixCats
My configuration is based off the nixCats 'simple' template found [here](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim/tree/main/templates/simple)

## My Goal
My aim is to create configurations for specific enviroments. For instance in an enviroment where I use C#; I can simply enable the *csharp* category declared inside *default.nix*. For my homeserver however, I would only enable the *nix* category or whatever else I might need for that enviroment.

## Checkout nixCats!
